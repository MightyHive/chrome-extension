## Generate a build

Builds are built from the `src/` folder and placed into the `dist/` directory. To create a distrubutable build, run `npm run build`.

## Contributing

This project utilizes Commitizen for its commit messages, with the `cz-conventional-changelog` preset. To set this up, install Commitizen globally: `npm i -g commitizen`. Local installations will _not_ create the Git alias for writing commits. 

To use, replace `git commit` in your workflow with `git cz` and select the appropriate category for your commmits.
